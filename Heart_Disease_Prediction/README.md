❤️ Heart Disease Classification using Machine Learning
📝 Overview
This project is a machine learning pipeline built in a Jupyter Notebook that aims to classify whether a person has heart disease based on medical parameters. It uses standard data science steps including data loading, exploration, preprocessing, and model training.

📁 Contents of the Notebook
✅ 1. Data Loading
The dataset heart.csv is loaded using Pandas.

Basic exploration includes shape, column names, datatypes, head/tail, and null value checks.

📊 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn:

Histograms for all numeric features.

Count plots to assess class balance (target variable).

Heatmap to visualize correlations.

🔄 3. Data Preprocessing
Features are separated from labels.

Train-test split is performed.

Feature scaling using StandardScaler ensures equal weight for all features.

🤖 4. Model Training
Three models are implemented and trained:

✅ K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

✅ Random Forest Classifier

✅ Decision Tree Classifier


Jupyter Notebook

Libraries:

pandas, numpy

matplotlib, seaborn

scikit-learn
