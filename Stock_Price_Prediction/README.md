# Stocks-Analysis-with-Pandas-and-Scikit-Learn
Stock price prediction using 3 methods of Regression

This purpose of this project is to build 3 different types of regression lines to predict stock prices using Python, then print out the prediction for the best performing one.

Step 1 - Go to Yahoo Finance and find a stock price that you want to predict. Click on historical data, then download the CSV of that stocks price history https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/history?p=AAPL

Step 2 - Use Scikit learn to try out 3 different types of regression models to predict the price of that stock for a future date and build different types of regression models (i.e quadratic, linear, lasso, ridge, etc.)

Step 3 - Visualize your result using matplotlib or another plotting library of your choice
